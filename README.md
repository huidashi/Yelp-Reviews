Yelp Data Analysis

Purpose of this project is to leverage Spark Cluster on AWS EMR to load and analyze many gigabytes of data. This new technology heavily changes computation and loading time on juypter notebook. In addition we want to further understand PySpark usages and limitations. I have manipulated and visualized data to find meaningful insights on business and yelp reviews.

Key Findings: elite members are biased and tend to rate business higher then regular members
